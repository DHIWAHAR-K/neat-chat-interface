  "That's a great question! Let me break it down for you.\n\n## Key Points\n\n1. **First**, consider the fundamentals\n2. **Second**, think about the broader context\n3. **Third**, apply critical thinking\n\nHere's a code example:\n\n```typescript\nconst greeting = (name: string) => {\n  return `Hello, ${name}!`;\n};\n\nconsole.log(greeting('World'));\n```\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!",
  "I'd be happy to help with that! Here's what I think:\n\n> The best way to learn is by doing.\n\nSome suggestions:\n- Start with the basics\n- Practice regularly\n- Don't be afraid to make mistakes\n- Ask questions when you're stuck\n\n| Approach | Difficulty | Effectiveness |\n|----------|-----------|---------------|\n| Reading  | Low       | Medium        |\n| Practice | Medium    | High          |\n| Teaching | High      | Very High     |",
  "Here's my take on this:\n\nThe concept is actually simpler than it might seem at first. Let me walk you through it step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Basics\n\nEvery complex system is built from simple components. The key is understanding how they connect.\n\n### Step 2: Building Up\n\nOnce you grasp the fundamentals, you can start combining them:\n\n```python\ndef solve(problem):\n    parts = break_down(problem)\n    solutions = [analyze(part) for part in parts]\n    return combine(solutions)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Iterating\n\nPerfection comes through iteration. Don't expect to get it right the first time!",
